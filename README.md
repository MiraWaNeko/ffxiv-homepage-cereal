## Setup

### 1. Fork or Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiraWaNeko/ffxiv-homepage
cd ffxiv-homepage
```

### 2. Configure Your Characters

Edit `update-characters.js` and update the `CHARACTERS` array with your character information:

```javascript
const CHARACTERS = [
  {
    id: 'YOUR_CHARACTER_ID',
    name: 'Character Name',
    world: 'Server Name [Data Center]',
    image: 'FULL_CHARACTER_IMAGE_URL'
  }
];
```

**Finding Your Character ID:**
- Go to your character's Lodestone page (e.g., `https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/24921505/`)
- The number in the URL is your character ID (`24921505` in this example)

**Getting the Full Character Image:**
- Visit your character's Lodestone page
- Right-click on the character portrait and select "Inspect"
- Find the image URL ending with `fl0.jpg` (this is the full-body image)
- Copy the complete URL including the query parameter

### 3. Update Social Media Links

Edit `index.html` and update the social media links:

```html
<a href="https://twitter.com/your-username" ...>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/your-handle.bsky.social" ...>
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 5. Fetch Character Data

Run the Lodestone parser to fetch your character data:

```bash
node update-characters.js
```

This will automatically fetch:
- All combat jobs (including base classes)
- All 8 crafting classes
- All 3 gathering classes
- All 15 Phantom Jobs with their levels
- Correct level information for each job

The parser automatically categorizes jobs and includes all jobs regardless of level (unleveled jobs show as level 0).

### 6. Test Locally

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the results.

### 7. Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push your changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages"
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

3. Enable GitHub Actions:
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - If prompted, enable GitHub Actions
   - The workflow will run automatically every 6 hours

4. Set up write permissions for GitHub Actions:
   - Go to Settings → Actions → General
   - Scroll to "Workflow permissions"
   - Select "Read and write permissions"
   - Click "Save"

### 8. Automatic Updates

Your character data will automatically update every 6 hours via GitHub Actions. The workflow fetches fresh data from the Lodestone and commits the updated `data.js` file.

## Job Badge Design

Jobs are displayed with a separated badge design:

- **Unlocked (Level 0)**: `[ JOB | - ]` - Dimmed appearance
- **In Progress**: `[ JOB | 79 ]` - Normal styling
- **Max Level**: `[ JOB | 100 ]` - Golden highlight on the level

The system recognizes custom max levels:
- **Most Jobs**: Level 100
- **Blue Mage**: Level 80
- **Phantom Jobs**: Levels 3-16 (varies by job)

## Phantom Jobs

Full support for all 15 Island Sanctuary Phantom Jobs:

- **Level 3**: Berserker
- **Level 4**: Chemist, Bard, Mystic Knight, Gladiator, Dancer
- **Level 5**: Samurai, Time Mage, Geomancer, Oracle
- **Level 6**: Knight, Monk, Thief, Ranger, Cannoneer
- **Level 16**: Freelancer

Phantom jobs are displayed without the "Phantom " prefix (e.g., "Knight" instead of "Phantom Knight").

## Customization

### Update Frequency

To change how often the data updates, edit `.github/workflows/update-characters.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours
```

Cron schedule examples:
- `0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours
- `0 */12 * * *` - Every 12 hours
- `0 0 * * *` - Once per day at midnight
- `0 0,12 * * *` - Twice per day (midnight and noon)

### Styling

Edit `styles.css` to customize:
- Colors and theme
- Layout and spacing
- Card designs
- Typography
- Job badge appearance

### Page Title and Header

Edit `index.html` to change:
- Page title: `<title>Your Title</title>`
- Main header: `<h1>Your Header</h1>`
- Footer text

### Max Levels

To adjust max levels for jobs, edit `render.js` and update the `MAX_LEVELS` object:

```javascript
const MAX_LEVELS = {
  'Blue Mage': 80,
  'Phantom Knight': 6,
  // Add more custom max levels here
};
```

## Files Overview

- `index.html` - Main HTML page structure
- `styles.css` - FFXIV-themed styling
- `data.js` - Character data (auto-generated from Lodestone)
- `render.js` - Dynamic rendering of character cards with job role categorization
- `update-characters.js` - Lodestone parser that fetches character data
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- `.github/workflows/update-characters.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for automatic updates

## How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**: `update-characters.js` scrapes your character's Lodestone page using Cheerio
2. **Job Parsing**:
   - Regular jobs use standard Lodestone selectors
   - Phantom Jobs use special `character__support_job` selectors
3. **Data Generation**: Creates `data.js` with structured character and job data
4. **Rendering**: `render.js` reads `data.js` and dynamically generates the HTML for each character
5. **Job Display**: Jobs are organized by role and displayed with appropriate styling based on level

## Troubleshooting

### Characters not updating

1. Check the Actions tab for any failed workflows
2. Verify your character IDs are correct in `update-characters.js`
3. Make sure GitHub Actions has write permissions
4. Check if the Lodestone is accessible (not under maintenance)

### Phantom Jobs not showing

1. Ensure you've completed Island Sanctuary content to unlock Phantom Jobs
2. Run `node update-characters.js` locally to verify parsing
3. Check that the Lodestone page shows your Phantom Jobs

### Styling issues

- Clear your browser cache
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure all files are properly uploaded to GitHub

### Data not displaying

- Verify `data.js` exists and has valid data
- Check browser console for module loading errors
- Ensure your web server supports ES6 modules
